## TP 2 Notes

- In **WebCGF functions for geometric transformations** exercise 3, we utilized the figures created in TP1. By applying geometric transformations, we reproduced the given tangram image and developed a single class, `MyTangram.js`, to represent it as a whole. We did not encounter any difficulties, as our tangram was relatively simple.
